# WEB_TechMission_practice
Making step-by-step changes to a web page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript in my local repository, committing and pushing the changes made to my GitHub branch via Git Gui. Please, look through my commits to understand what I did.
Please, keep in mind the file qa.html is not my job. My job only was to do chages in the code which you can look in commits
